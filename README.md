## Experimental ROS 2 Learning Codes

Welcome to the repository of various experimental codes aimed at learning the basics of ROS 2 Humble. This repository contains a collection of scripts and projects that are used to understand and experiment with the fundamental concepts and functionalities of ROS 2.

### Contents

This repository includes:

- **Basic ROS 2 Node Examples**: Simple examples to demonstrate the creation and execution of ROS 2 nodes.
- **Publisher and Subscriber Examples**: Codes to illustrate how to set up publishers and subscribers in ROS 2.
- **Service and Action Examples**: Samples showing how to create and call ROS 2 services and actions.
- **Parameter Server Usage**: Examples on how to use the parameter server in ROS 2.
- **Custom Messages and Services**: Codes demonstrating the creation and usage of custom messages and services in ROS 2.
- **Robot Simulation with Gazebo**: Basic simulation setups using Gazebo to control and monitor robots.
- **Launch Files**: Examples of how to use launch files in ROS 2 to start multiple nodes and set parameters.
- **Navigation and SLAM**: Basic implementations of navigation and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using ROS 2.
